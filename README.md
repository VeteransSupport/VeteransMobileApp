# Installation

### Some basic info
You'll need NodeJS and npm installed in your machine. It is recommended that you install NodeJS from their website (https://nodejs.org/en/), as the installation already contains npm.

You will also need to install the **Expo Go** app on a mobile device to run the application.

_**NOTE:** *Some of these commands may require admin permissions, so make sure to run them as admin (sudo for Linux/Mac, run as admin in windows)*_

1. Install Expo CLI tools (preferrably globaly) with **npm install --global expo-cli**

3. Run the project with **expo start**
4. Press **d** when the menu appears in thge terminal window which will open developer tools in your default browser
5. Change the **CONNECTION** type to tunnel.
